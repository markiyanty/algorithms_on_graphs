# Algorithms on Graphs - LeetCode Exercises

Welcome to our university project repository, where we dive into the fascinating world of graph theory and tackle a wide array of challenges provided by LeetCode. This repository serves as a central hub for students and enthusiasts alike, who are eager to explore and solve graph-related problems ranging from the basic to the advanced.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Exercises Directory:** A comprehensive collection of LeetCode graph problems. Each problem is categorized by its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and comes with a detailed problem statement, a solution file (initially blank for you to fill), and a solution guide for reference.
- **Learning Resources:** Curated materials and links to foundational concepts in graph theory, which will help you understand the underlying principles needed to tackle these exercises.
- **Discussion Board:** A place for collaborators to discuss problem-solving strategies, share insights, and seek or offer help on specific challenges.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repo to your local machine to get access to all the exercises and resources.
   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/markiyanty/algorithms_on_graphs.git>
   ```
2. **Pick an Exercise:** Navigate to the Exercises Directory, choose a problem that interests you, and start coding your solution.
3. **Test Your Solution:** Use the provided test cases in the exercise file or create your own to ensure your solution works as expected.
4. **Compare and Learn:** Once you've attempted the problem, compare your approach with the solution guide. Reflect on different strategies and optimizations.

## Contributing
